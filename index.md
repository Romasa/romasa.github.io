I am Romasa Qasim, I am a student, a teacher, a researcher, a mother, an overthinker, a day-dreamer, a cook, and an introvert under the cloak of an extrovert. I love to travel and read book.

**By Profession:**\
I am currently working as a Research Associate in Bouchnita lab at University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). 

Before joining UTEP, I was a lecturer in the Computer Science and Engineering department of Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB). During my tenure as a lecturer, I taught courses like [C++](https://github.com/Romasa/Introductory-Programming-with-C-Plus-Plus) and [Python](https://github.com/Romasa/Introduction-to-python).

**By Education:**\
I have started my dream PhD journey in Computational Science at [University of Texas at El Paso](https://www.utep.edu/science) in Fall 2022. I have completed Ms in [Computational Sceince](https://www.utep.edu/science/computational-science/) from [University of Texas at El Paso, Texas, USA](https://www.utep.edu/). Before that I have earned [MS in Computer Science](https://www.northsouth.edu/academic/programs-18022021/master/ms-cse.html) and Engineering with distinction from [North South University](https://www.northsouth.edu/), Bangladesh. My undergraduate was in [Computer Science](https://uok.edu.pk/faculties/computerscience/bs.php) from [University of Karachi](https://uok.edu.pk/), Pakistan.

**By Philosophy:**\
I am a citizen of a dream land where law and justice are above everything, where nobody is dying of hunger, where the best medication and treatment is provided to everyone free of cost. 

I will write my daily life experiences while pursuing my dream journey to PhD with two loving kids and will post it here, so hang on. Other philosophical ideas will come along right here too.
