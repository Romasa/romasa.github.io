It is a whole story in itself that before arriviing into USA for my PhD, I decided to document all the interesting events but ironically, I only get to start it now, (hopefully my last year of PhD). Intelligents get the point that I spent my last three years in PSTD (PhD Shock/Stress To Death). No, its not just PhD which stress you out. It is a mix of country shift, food habits change, new-founded need of being more organized, living on your own, and ofcourse studies+research.
