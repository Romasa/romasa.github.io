I got this idea to document what I read when I had to develop a website as a project in my 3rd year of undergraduate. The main idea was to make a website where people can give reviews and comments about the books they read, so that other people can get recommendation for their next readings. Basically a virtual place for the book lovers like me. I always setup a library wherever I get to stay for a few years, and books are my partners along long journeys. 

I usually like thrillers, history and philosophical type books. Sci-fi was never my interst. Interstingly, I find a unique interest in reading books written for kids. I love the innocense, puriy and simple stories written for the creative little minds. Unlike most other book lovers, I don't have the tendency to read the same book multiple times, except [this greatest book of all times](the_quran.md)
